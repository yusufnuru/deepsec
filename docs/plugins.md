# Plugins

A deepsec plugin can fill any of five slots:

| Slot | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `matchers` | Additional regex matchers, registered alongside the built-ins |
| `notifiers` | Where findings get reported (Slack, GitHub Issues, webhooks…) |
| `ownership` | Map files to owning teams/people (e.g. an internal directory) |
| `people` | Look up a person by email/name (managers, on-call, contact info) |
| `executor` | Run a deepsec command on remote infrastructure |

A single plugin can fill any subset.

The plugin contract lives in
[`packages/core/src/plugin.ts`](../packages/core/src/plugin.ts):

```ts
export interface DeepsecPlugin {
  name: string;
  matchers?: MatcherPlugin[];
  notifiers?: NotifierPlugin[];
  ownership?: OwnershipProvider;
  people?: PeopleProvider;
  executor?: ExecutorProvider;
  agents?: AgentPluginRef[];
  commands?: (program: unknown) => void;  // commander program
}
```

Plugins are loaded from `deepsec.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "deepsec/config";
import myPlugin from "@my-org/deepsec-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
  projects: [{ id: "my-app", root: "../my-app" }],
  plugins: [myPlugin({ /* options */ })],
});
```

## Where to put your plugin

For an org-internal plugin: a workspace package inside this repo, or a
sibling repo. Either works; pnpm/npm workspaces handle the resolution.
For a shared plugin: publish to npm under your scope.

Naming convention: `@<scope>/plugin-<thing>` (Vite style),
e.g. `@my-org/plugin-internal-services`.

## Slot 1: matchers

Most common. Same shape as a built-in matcher; see
[writing-matchers.md](writing-matchers.md) for how to write one.

```ts
// my-plugin/src/matchers/internal-rpc.ts
import type { MatcherPlugin, CandidateMatch } from "deepsec/config";
import { regexMatcher } from "deepsec/config";

export const internalRpcMatcher: MatcherPlugin = {
  slug: "internal-rpc-no-auth",
  description: "Internal RPC handler without auth interceptor",
  noiseTier: "precise",
  filePatterns: ["**/*.go"],
  match(content, filePath) {
    return regexMatcher("internal-rpc-no-auth", [
      { regex: /NewMyServiceHandler\s*\([^)]*\)/, label: "service handler" },
    ], content);
  },
};
```

```ts
// my-plugin/src/index.ts
import type { DeepsecPlugin } from "deepsec/config";
import { internalRpcMatcher } from "./matchers/internal-rpc.js";

export default function myPlugin(): DeepsecPlugin {
  return {
    name: "@my-org/plugin-internal-services",
    matchers: [internalRpcMatcher],
  };
}
```

Activate it:

```ts
// deepsec.config.ts
import myPlugin from "@my-org/plugin-internal-services";
export default defineConfig({
  projects: [/* … */],
  plugins: [myPlugin()],
});
```

The plugin's matchers are registered alongside deepsec's built-ins. Slugs
are unique. If your slug collides with a built-in, **the plugin wins**
(last-registered overrides). Useful for swapping a built-in matcher for
a tighter org-specific version.

A complete inline-plugin example with two real matchers lives at
[`samples/webapp/deepsec.config.ts`](../samples/webapp/deepsec.config.ts) and
[`samples/webapp/matchers/`](../samples/webapp/matchers/) — the same
shape as a published plugin, just defined in the user's config file.

## Slot 2: ownership

`ownership` maps a file to the team or person that owns it. `deepsec
enrich` attaches this data to findings. Useful for routing notifications
and prioritizing review.

The contract:

```ts
interface OwnershipProvider {
  name: string;
  fetchOwnership(args: { filePath: string; repo: string }): Promise<OwnershipData | null>;
}
```

`OwnershipData` covers contributors, escalation teams, manager email,
on-call info. See `packages/core/src/types.ts:OwnershipData`.

Return `null` when ownership data is unavailable; callers treat that as
a soft-fail.

A minimal ownership provider that reads from a CODEOWNERS file:

```ts
import type { OwnershipProvider } from "deepsec/config";
import fs from "node:fs";

export function codeownersProvider(rootPath: string): OwnershipProvider {
  return {
    name: "codeowners",
    async fetchOwnership({ filePath }) {
      // Parse CODEOWNERS, match filePath against globs, return the
      // first matching team/email.
      // Return null if no match or file doesn't exist.
      // ...
    },
  };
}
```

An external organization plugin can wrap an internal directory or
ownership oracle the same way.

## Slot 3: people

`people` looks up a person by email or name and returns their metadata
(manager, slack handle, github username). Used by ownership and by
notifiers for @-mentions and escalation.

```ts
interface PeopleProvider {
  name: string;
  lookup(query: string): Promise<Person | null>;
  lookupManager?(person: Person): Promise<Person | null>;
}
```

`Person` has a generic core (`name`, `email`, `title`, `managerKey`) plus
an `extra` map for provider-specific fields (e.g. `slackId`, `slackHandle`).

An external organization plugin can wrap an internal people directory
the same way.

## Slot 4: notifiers

`notifiers` are where findings get reported. Slack, GitHub Issues,
webhooks, an internal incident system; whatever fits.

```ts
interface NotifierPlugin {
  name: string;
  notify(params: NotifyParams): Promise<FindingNotification>;
}
```

`NotifyParams` carries the finding, the FileRecord, and the projectId.
`FindingNotification` carries an `externalId` and `externalUrl` for
correlation back to the source.

deepsec doesn't ship a notifier in core. The original Slack notifier was
removed during open-sourcing because Slack belongs in a plugin. A
GitHub Issues notifier would be a good first plugin to write.

## Slot 5: executor

`executor` runs deepsec commands on remote infrastructure. The in-tree
`@vercel/sandbox` executor is the canonical example. Docker, Kubernetes,
and AWS-Batch executors all fit here.

```ts
interface ExecutorProvider {
  name: string;
  launch(req: ExecutorLaunchRequest, onLog: (m: string) => void): Promise<string>;  // runId
  collect(runId: string): Promise<void>;
  status?(runId: string): Promise<ExecutorStatus>;
}
```

The Vercel-Sandbox path lives in
[`packages/deepsec/src/sandbox/`](../packages/deepsec/src/sandbox); it's
not yet routed through `ExecutorProvider`. That refactor is on the
roadmap. For now, this is the most experimental slot of the five.

## Testing your plugin

Drop-in pattern:

```ts
// my-plugin/src/__tests__/plugin.test.ts
import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";
import { createDefaultRegistry } from "deepsec/config";
import myPlugin from "../index.js";

describe("@my-org/plugin-internal-services", () => {
  it("contributes the expected matchers", () => {
    const plugin = myPlugin();
    const slugs = plugin.matchers!.map(m => m.slug);
    expect(slugs).toContain("internal-rpc-no-auth");
  });

  it("does not collide with built-ins", () => {
    const built = new Set(createDefaultRegistry().slugs());
    const plugin = myPlugin();
    for (const m of plugin.matchers ?? []) {
      // Either the slug is unique, or you're intentionally overriding.
      // Document the overrides loudly.
    }
  });
});
```

## Resolution order

`ownership`, `people`, and `executor` are single-slot. The **last**
plugin to declare each wins. So a generic `codeowners` ownership plugin
can load first, and an org-specific oracle later in the `plugins: [...]`
array overrides it.

`matchers`, `notifiers`, and `agents` are additive. All plugin
contributions stack.
