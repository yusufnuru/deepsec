# deepsec

`deepsec` an agent-powered vulnerability scanner that you can run in your own infrastructure, optimized to perform on-demand review of all code in existing 
large-scale repos.

`deepsec` is designed to surface hard-to-find issues that have been lurking in applications for a long time. It is configured to use the best models at maximum thinking levels, meaning scans can cost thousands or even tens-of-thousands of dollars for large codebases. Our customers have found the cost worth it for how quickly they were able to patch vulnerabilities that would have otherwise gone unfixed.

For large codebases, work fans out across worker machines in parallel.
Commands are idempotent — interrupt a job, restart it, and deepsec picks up
where it left off.

## Get started

Navigate to the root of the repository that you want to scan, then:

```bash
npx deepsec init       # creates .deepsec/ with this repo as the first project
cd .deepsec
pnpm install           # installs deepsec from npm

# Proceed as instructed by `init` output
```

Now have your coding agent bootstrap your installation. Open the agent of choice
and prompt:

> Read `.deepsec/node_modules/deepsec/SKILL.md` to understand the
> tool. Then read `.deepsec/data/<id>/SETUP.md` and follow it:
> skim this repo's README, any AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, and a handful
> of representative code files, then replace each section of
> `.deepsec/data/<id>/INFO.md`.
>
> Keep it SHORT — target 50–100 lines total. Pick 3–5 examples per
> section, not exhaustive enumeration. Name primitives (auth helpers,
> middleware) but no line numbers. Skip generic CWE categories —
> built-in matchers cover those. Cover only what's project-specific.
> INFO.md is injected into every scan batch; verbose context dilutes
> signal.

Then scan from inside `.deepsec/`:

```bash
pnpm deepsec scan
pnpm deepsec process    
pnpm deepsec revalidate # optional, cuts FP rate
pnpm deepsec export --format md-dir --out ./findings
```

## AI provider

When running locally, `deepsec` attempts to use your existing subscriptions
when invoking claude or codex.

For scaled usage on large code bases we recommend using Vercel AI Gateway or
provider API keys. The AI Gateway has default quotas suitable for highly 
concurrent research.

```
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=vck_...
```

That single key covers both Claude and Codex. See 
[docs/vercel-setup.md](docs/vercel-setup.md) for getting a key and for 
the Vercel Sandbox setup. To bypass the gateway, set `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` 
+ `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` (or the OpenAI pair) explicitly. Explicit values 
always win over the `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` expansion.

## Distributed execution (optional)

Large monorepos can fan work across [Vercel Sandbox](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-sandbox) microVMs:

```bash
pnpm deepsec sandbox process --project-id my-app --sandboxes 10 --concurrency 4
```

Needs a Vercel account. The local working tree is tarballed and
uploaded; `.git` is excluded. Both OIDC tokens (local) and access
tokens (CI) are supported — see
[docs/vercel-setup.md](docs/vercel-setup.md).

## Security model of deepsec itself

Treat `deepsec` like a coding agent with full shell access on the enviroment that it is
running on. It is designed to run on trusted inputs (your source code) but you may still
be concerned about prompt injection due to external dependencies or vendored code.

Running on a sandbox (see above) does limit the potential exposure substantially:

- The API keys for the coding agents are injected outside of the sandbox and hence cannot be exfiltrated
- For the worker sandboxes, network egress from the sandbox is limited to coding agent hosts (Egress is allowed during the bootstrap process, but this does not run the coding agent)
