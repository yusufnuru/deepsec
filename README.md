# deepsec

`deepsec` an agent-powered vulnerability scanner that you can run in your own infrastructure, optimized to perform on-demand review of all code in existing 
large-scale repos.

`deepsec` is designed to surface hard-to-find issues that have been lurking in applications for a long time. It is configured to use the best models at maximum thinking levels, meaning scans can cost thousands or even tens-of-thousands of dollars for large codebases. Our customers have found the cost worth it for how quickly they were able to patch vulnerabilities that would have otherwise gone unfixed.

For large codebases, work fans out across worker machines in parallel.
Commands are idempotent — interrupt a job, restart it, and deepsec picks up
where it left off.

## Get started

deepsec is polyglot (TS, Go, Python, Lua, Terraform, …). It lives in
a `.deepsec/` directory at the root of the codebase you scan —
checked into the same git repo, so the config, project context
(auth shape, threat model), and per-project setup prompts travel
with the code. Generated scan output (findings, run metadata) stays
gitignored.

From the root of the codebase you want to scan:

```bash
npx deepsec init       # creates .deepsec/ with this repo as the first project
cd .deepsec
pnpm install           # installs deepsec from npm
```

The scaffold is minimal: `deepsec.config.ts` (one `projects[]` entry
pointing at `..`), `data/<id>/INFO.md` (template — repo context that
gets injected into every AI prompt), `data/<id>/SETUP.md` (per-project
agent setup prompt), `package.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `.env.local`,
`.gitignore`. No custom matchers by default — add them later when a
real finding suggests one.

Two things to do before scanning:

**1. Paste your AI Gateway, Anthropic, or OpenAI token into `.env.local`.** See
[docs/vercel-setup.md](docs/vercel-setup.md) for how to get started.

**2. Have your coding agent fill in `data/<id>/INFO.md`.** Open the
codebase in Claude Code / Cursor / Codex CLI / etc., then paste this
prompt (replace `<id>` with the project id `init` printed):

> Read `.deepsec/node_modules/deepsec/SKILL.md` to understand the
> tool. Then read `.deepsec/data/<id>/SETUP.md` and follow it:
> skim this repo's README, any AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, and a handful
> of representative code files, then replace each section of
> `.deepsec/data/<id>/INFO.md`.
>
> Keep it SHORT — target 50–100 lines total. Pick 3–5 examples per
> section, not exhaustive enumeration. Name primitives (auth helpers,
> middleware) but no line numbers. Skip generic CWE categories —
> built-in matchers cover those. Cover only what's project-specific.
> INFO.md is injected into every scan batch; verbose context dilutes
> signal.

Then scan from inside `.deepsec/`:

```bash
pnpm deepsec scan
pnpm deepsec process     --concurrency 5
pnpm deepsec revalidate  --concurrency 5                       # optional, cuts FP rate
pnpm deepsec export      --format md-dir --out ./findings
```

(`--project-id` is auto-resolved when the config has one project. Pass
`--project-id <id>` once you've registered more.)

`scan` is free (regex only). `process` is the expensive AI stage
(≈$0.30/file on Opus by default — see
[docs/models.md](docs/models.md) to pick a cheaper model). Run state
goes to `.deepsec/data/<id>/`; everything except curated
`INFO.md`/`SETUP.md` is gitignored. Schema in
[docs/data-layout.md](docs/data-layout.md).

## AI provider

When running locally, `deepsec` attempts to use your existing subscriptions
when invoking claude or codex.

For scaled usage on large code bases we recommend using Vercel AI Gateway or
provider API keys. The AI Gateway has default quotas suitable for highly 
concurrent research.

```
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=vck_...
```

That single key covers both Claude and Codex; deepsec expands it into
the `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `*_BASE_URL` quartet
the SDKs read. See [docs/vercel-setup.md](docs/vercel-setup.md) for
getting a key and for the Vercel Sandbox setup. To bypass the
gateway, set `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` + `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` (or the
OpenAI pair) explicitly — explicit values always win over the
`AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` expansion.

For local-only runs (`process` / `revalidate` / `triage`, not
`sandbox …`), deepsec also picks up an existing Claude Code or Codex
subscription on the laptop — `claude login` / `codex login` is enough,
no API key required. See [docs/vercel-setup.md § Use your Claude Code
or Codex subscription](docs/vercel-setup.md#use-your-claude-code-or-codex-subscription-non-sandbox-only).

## Severity levels

| Severity   | Meaning                                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `CRITICAL` | Immediate exploit / data exposure                       |
| `HIGH`     | Exploitable, real-world impact                          |
| `HIGH_BUG` | Major non-security bug (data loss, corruption, outage)  |
| `MEDIUM`   | Medium-severity security vulnerability                  |
| `BUG`      | Notable non-security bug (logic error, race, leak)      |
| `LOW`      | Minor / informational                                   |

## Plugins

Five extension slots: `matchers`, `notifiers`, `ownership`, `people`,
`executor`. A plugin can be inline or imported from a separate npm
package.

```ts
// deepsec.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "deepsec/config";
import myPlugin from "@my-org/deepsec-plugin-foo";

export default defineConfig({
  projects: [{ id: "my-app", root: "../my-app" }],
  plugins: [myPlugin()],
});
```

See [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md). For a worked inline plugin
with two custom matchers, see
[`samples/webapp/deepsec.config.ts`](samples/webapp/deepsec.config.ts).

## Distributed execution (optional)

Large monorepos can fan work across [Vercel Sandbox](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-sandbox) microVMs:

```bash
pnpm deepsec sandbox process --project-id my-app --sandboxes 10 --concurrency 4
```

Needs a Vercel account. The local working tree is tarballed and
uploaded; `.git` is excluded. Both OIDC tokens (local) and access
tokens (CI) are supported — see
[docs/vercel-setup.md](docs/vercel-setup.md).

## Security model of deepsec itself

Treat `deepsec` like a coding agent with full shell access on the enviroment that it is
running on. It is designed to run on trusted inputs (your source code) but you may still
be concerned about prompt injection due to external dependencies or vendored code.

Running on a sandbox (see above) does limit the potential exposure substantially:

- The API keys for the coding agents are injected outside of the sandbox and hence cannot be exfiltrated
- For the worker sandboxes, network egress from the sandbox is limited to coding agent hosts (Egress is allowed during the bootstrap process, but this does not run the coding agent)
